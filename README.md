# Maxcrafted++

Welcome to Maxcrafted++, a Minecraft Bedrock addon pack for 1.20+. This pack primarily focuses on adding content to the base game, but also changes how some vanilla things work.

In Maxcrafted++, you'll come across new creatures, new weapons, new tools, new armor, new materials, and much more.

## Gameplay Changes
- The day and night cycles have been adjusted. Each day is now either 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or 60 minutes long, with daytime and nighttime making up 15/20/30 minutes each (This can be chosen in-game using the /function command).
- Squids can be bred using Raw Cod. Glow Squids can be bred using Tropical Fish.

## Visual Changes
