# Maxcrafted++

Welcome to Maxcrafted++, a Minecraft Bedrock addon pack for 1.20+. This pack primarily focuses on adding content to the base game, but also changes how some vanilla things work.

In Maxcrafted++, you'll come across new creatures, new weapons, new tools, new armor, new materials, and much more.

## Gameplay Changes from Vanilla Minecraft
